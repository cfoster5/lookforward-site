      <h1 class="title is-1">Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on LookForward’s apps for iOS and Android
        devices.</p>

      <h2 class="title is-3">Information we collect</h2>

      <!-- <p>New Overcast accounts are created anonymously, without email addresses or passwords.</p>

      <p>You may optionally add an email address and a password to your account, or remove the email address and
        password from your account, at any time in Overcast’s app. Email addresses are <strong>only</strong> used for
        logging in, password resets, responding to emails that you initiate, and sending notifications that you
        request. We don’t send promotional emails.</p>

      <p>We store information about your podcasts, episodes, and listening progress to sync this information between
        the website and your devices. We also collect anonymous statistics about which podcasts are most popular to
        help inform our recommendation engine.</p> -->

      <p>New LookForward accounts are created with an email address and password. Email addresses are
        <strong>only</strong> used for
        logging in, password resets, responding to emails that you initiate, and sending notifications that you
        request. We don’t send promotional emails.</p>

      <h3 class="title is-4">Technical basics</h3>
      <p>If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We <strong>never</strong> use notifications
        for marketing.</p>
      <p>If you add an item to your countdown list, we need to store it until you delete it.</p>
      <p>We use tokens in the app to keep you logged in.</p>

      <!-- <h3 class="title is-4">Ads and analytics</h3>

      <p>Overcast’s app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular
        features, to improve the app.</p>

      <p>No personal data is used to target Overcast’s ads except the categories of podcasts that you’re subscribed
        to, such as “Technology” or “Business”. Each ad collects, and shares with its advertiser, only three numbers:
        total views, total taps, and total subscriptions from the ad.</p> -->

      <h2 class="title is-3">Information usage</h2>

      <p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our app.</p>

      <p>We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish
        LookForward’s functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many
        people have a particular media release in their countdown list.</p>

      <p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to
        exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
        illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and
        property.</p>

      <p>In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user
        information may be among the transferred assets.</p>

      <h2 class="title is-3">Security</h2>

      <p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. Passwords are <a
          href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hashed</a>, not stored, using
        industry-standard methods (currently a modified version of <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt">scrypt</a>).</p>

      <h2 class="title is-3">Accessing, changing, or deleting information</h2>

      <!-- <p>You may access or change your information or delete your account from the Overcast iOS app.</p> -->
      <p>You may access or change your information from the LookForward app.</p>

      <p>LookForward may delete your information at any time and for any reason, such as technical needs, legal
        concerns,
        abuse prevention, removal of idle accounts, data loss, or any other reason.</p>

      <h2 class="title is-3">Third-party links and content</h2>

      <p>Lookforward displays content from third-party sites. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we
        have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.</p>

      <h2 class="title is-3">California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>

      <p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal
        information to outside parties without your consent.</p>

      <h2 class="title is-3">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>

      <p>We never collect or maintain information in our app from those we actually know are under 13, and no part
        of our app is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

      <h2 class="title is-3">Information for European Union Customers</h2>

      <p>By using LookForward and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your
        information outside of the European Union.</p>

      <h2 class="title is-3">International Transfers of Information</h2>

      <p>Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data privacy
        laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on where it is
        processed, stored, or used.</p>

      <h2 class="title is-3">Your Consent</h2>

      <p>By using our app, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>

      <!-- <h2 class="title is-3">Contacting Us</h2> -->

      <!-- <p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email <a
          href="mailto:privacy@overcast.fm">privacy@overcast.fm</a>. -->
      <!-- Please note that account deletion should be done within the Overcast app, not via email requests, for security
        reasons. -->
      <!-- </p> -->

      <h2 class="title is-3">Changes to this policy</h2>

      <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Summary of changes so
        far:</p>
